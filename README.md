This is uhmm, different to most of my repositories.

So I find myself building some random shit sometimes, or trying to recreate a design I saw in a tutorial or blog, and these stuff most times aren't fully fledged websites or applications which makes them well, not suitable for hosting individually? Anyways, this site is a collection of these "not fully-fledged" creations.

You can go through it if you want though. T for please don't criticize too much please, these are just random stuffðŸ˜….
